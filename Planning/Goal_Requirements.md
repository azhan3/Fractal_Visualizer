# Fractal Visualizer - Goals and Requirements

## Project Goals
1. Develop a program that generates a visual representation of fractals based on models of Zp.
2. Allow the user to specify the form of numbers to be represented in the fractal.
3. Support comparisons between numbers of specific forms within the fractal.
4. Initially focus on prime values of p up to 13.
5. Provide the ability to toggle the visibility of points that are not specified.
6. Implement zoom-in/out functionality for enhanced visualization.

## Functional Requirements
1. The program should take an input value p and generate a visual representation of the fractal associated with Zp.
2. The user should be able to specify the desired form of numbers to be represented in the fractal (e.g., congruent to 1 mod 3).
3. The program should display the fractal with different colors or symbols to distinguish numbers of different forms.
4. The program should allow the user to compare and contrast numbers of specific forms within the fractal.
5. The user should have the option to toggle the visibility of points that do not match the specified form.
6. The program should provide zoom-in and zoom-out functionality to enable detailed examination of the fractal.
