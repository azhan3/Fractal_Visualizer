## Test Case Document: Algorithm 2 Fractal Generation

### Test Case 1: Generate Sierpinski Gasket (p=3)
- Description: The test ensures that Algorithm 2 generates a Sierpinski gasket fractal when `p` is set to 3.
- Input:
    - `p`: 3
- Expected Output:
    - A fractal resembling the Sierpinski gasket with p (3) roots of unity.

### Test Case 2: Generate Square Fractal with Fractal in the Middle (p=5)
- Description: The test verifies that Algorithm 2 generates a square fractal with a fractal shape in the middle when `p` is set to 5.
- Input:
    - `p`: 5
- Expected Output:
    - A square-shaped fractal with p-1 (4) roots of unity, where the fractal pattern is repeated in the middle of the square.

### Test Case 3: Generate Hexagon Fractal with Fractal in the Middle (p=7)
- Description: The test validates that Algorithm 2 produces a hexagon fractal with a fractal shape in the middle when `p` is set to 7.
- Input:
    - `p`: 7
- Expected Output:
    - A hexagon-shaped fractal with p-1 (6) roots of unity, where the fractal pattern is repeated in the middle of the hexagon.
