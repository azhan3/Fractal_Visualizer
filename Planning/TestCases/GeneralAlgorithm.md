# Test Case: AlgorithmGeneralCase

## Description
Verify the functionality of the `AlgorithmGeneralCase` class for performing calculations and transformations based on the provided parameters.

## Steps
1. Create an instance of `AlgorithmGeneralCase` with the parameters:
    - `p = 3`
    - `l = 1.5`
    - `outputLength = 5`
2. Call the `toPlane` method with the input value `n = 0`.
3. Retrieve the result `double` array.
4. Verify that the result `double` array has size 2.
5. Verify that the first element in the result `double` array is 1.0, representing the x-coordinate of the center point.
6. Verify that the second element in the result `double` array is 0.0, representing the y-coordinate of the center point.
7. Call the `toPlane` method with the input value `n = 1`.
8. Retrieve the result `double` array.
9. Verify that the result `double` array has size 2.
10. Verify that the first element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of 1.5, representing the x-coordinate of the first point in the PAddic expansion of 1.
11. Verify that the second element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of 0.0, representing the y-coordinate of the first point in the PAddic expansion of 1.
12. Call the `toPlane` method with the input value `n = 2`.
13. Retrieve the result `double` array.
14. Verify that the result `double` array has size 2.
15. Verify that the first element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of 1.125, representing the x-coordinate of the second point in the PAddic expansion of 2.
16. Verify that the second element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of 1.299038105676658, representing the y-coordinate of the second point in the PAddic expansion of 2.
17. Call the `toPlane` method with the input value `n = 3`.
18. Retrieve the result `double` array.
19. Verify that the result `double` array has size 2.
20. Verify that the first element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of -0.375, representing the x-coordinate of the third point in the PAddic expansion of 3.
21. Verify that the second element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of 1.7320508075688774, representing the y-coordinate of the third point in the PAddic expansion of 3.
22. Call the `toPlane` method with the input value `n = 4`.
23. Retrieve the result `double` array.
24. Verify that the result `double` array has size 2.
25. Verify that the first element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of -0.75, representing the x-coordinate of the fourth point in the PAddic expansion of 4.
26. Verify that the second element in the result `double` array is within a tolerance of 0.8660254037844387, representing the y-coordinate of the fourth point in the PAddic expansion of 4.

## Expected Result
The `AlgorithmGeneralCase` class should correctly calculate and transform the points based on the provided parameters. The `toPlane` method should return the expected x and y coordinates for the given input values. The results should be within a tolerance due to floating-point precision.
