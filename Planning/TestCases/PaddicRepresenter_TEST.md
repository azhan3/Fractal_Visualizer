# Test Case: PAddicRepresenter

## Description
Verify the functionality of the `PAddicRepresenter` class for performing calculations and transformations based on the provided parameters, specifically for PAddic expansion.

## Steps
1. Create an instance of `PAddicRepresenter` with the parameters:
    - `p = 3`
    - `l = 1.5`
    - `outputLength = 5`
2. Call the `transformSample` method with the input value `ns = 10`.
3. Retrieve the result `PointList`.
4. Verify that the size of the result `PointList` is equal to 11.
5. Verify that the first point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(0.0, 0.0)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 0.
6. Verify that the second point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(1.5, 0.0)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 1.
7. Verify that the third point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(1.125, 1.299038105676658)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 2.
8. Verify that the fourth point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(-0.375, 1.7320508075688774)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 3.
9. Verify that the fifth point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(-0.75, 0.8660254037844387)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 4.
10. Verify that the sixth point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(-0.75, -0.8660254037844384)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 5.
11. Verify that the seventh point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(-0.375, -1.7320508075688774)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 6.
12. Verify that the eighth point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(1.125, -1.2990381056766578)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 7.
13. Verify that the ninth point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(0.75, 0.0)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 8.
14. Verify that the tenth point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(0.28125, 0.5130314318241487)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 9.
15. Verify that the eleventh point in the result `PointList` has coordinates `(-0.09375, 0.8109302162163288)`, representing the PAddic expansion of 10.

## Expected Result
The `PAddicRepresenter` class should correctly calculate and transform the points based on the provided parameters, representing the PAddic expansion of the given input values. The result `PointList` should contain the expected points representing the fractal model for PAddic expansion.

Note: The expected coordinates mentioned above are for illustration purposes only and may not reflect the actual values generated by the code. Actual results may vary.
