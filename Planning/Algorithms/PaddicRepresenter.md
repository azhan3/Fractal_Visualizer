PAddicExpansion Calculation Pseudocode:

1. Create an instance of PAddicRepresenter with the provided values of p, l, and outputLength.
2. Create an empty PointList to store the primary points.
3. Create an empty secondary PointList to store the points that adhere to the prime race 3x+2.

4. Iterate over values of n from 0 to ns:
    5. Calculate the plane coordinates using the toPlane() method:
        6. Initialize real and imag variables to 0.0.
        7. Decompose n into base-p digits using the completedIntToBase() method.
        8. For each digit in the decomposition:
            9. Calculate the power as l raised to the power of the digit's index.
            10. Calculate the angle as the digit multiplied by 2 * PI / p.
            11. Update the real and imag variables by adding the product of the power, cosine of the angle, and the digit.
    12. Store the calculated coordinates as (x, y).

    13. Add the coordinates (x, y) to the primary PointList.

    14. Check if the point adheres to the prime race 3x+2:
        15. Calculate the expression 3x + 2 and check if the result is an integer.
        16. If the result is an integer:
            17. Add the coordinates (x, y) to the secondary PointList.

18. Return the primary PointList.
