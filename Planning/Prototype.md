# Fractal Prototype: Sierpinski Gasket with Prime Race

## Description

This prototype demonstrates a fractal visualization of the Sierpinski Gasket, where points representing numbers in the prime race are highlighted in red. The prime race refers to a sequence of numbers where each number is obtained by adding the two preceding numbers. The Sierpinski Gasket is a well-known fractal pattern formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles.

## Fractal Details

- Fractal Type: Sierpinski Gasket
- Parameter (p): 3

## Prime Race

In this prototype, the prime race sequence is generated by starting with two initial numbers, and each subsequent number is obtained by adding the two preceding numbers. Points representing the numbers in the prime race sequence are highlighted in red within the fractal visualization.

## Visualization

The Sierpinski Gasket fractal is rendered using a recursive algorithm that subdivides the initial equilateral triangle into smaller triangles. The points within the fractal that correspond to numbers in the prime race sequence are marked with red color to distinguish them from the rest of the fractal.

## Conclusion

This prototype combines the beauty of the Sierpinski Gasket fractal with the concept of the prime race, showcasing the interplay between mathematics and visual aesthetics. It serves as a starting point for further exploration and development of interactive fractal visualizations.
