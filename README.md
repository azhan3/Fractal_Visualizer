# Fractal Visualizer Project

Welcome to the Fractal Visualizer project! This project aims to create a web application for visualizing fractals using modern web technologies.

## Project Overview

The Fractal Visualizer project is built with a combination of technologies, including Vert.x for the server-side logic, React for the frontend user interface, and CSS for styling and rendering. The project involves implementing various algorithms for fractal generation, connecting the math calculations to the frontend, and providing a visually appealing user interface for interacting with and exploring fractals.

## Features

- Fractal generation algorithms
- Server-side API endpoints for data retrieval and processing
- Interactive frontend interface for visualizing and exploring fractals
- CSS viewport for rendering points and fractal representations
- Comprehensive test cases to ensure functionality and reliability
- UML diagrams to illustrate the project's architecture and relationships

## Getting Started

To get started with the Fractal Visualizer project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the necessary dependencies for both the server and the frontend:
    - Server: navigate to the server directory and run `npm install`
    - Frontend: navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install`
3. Configure the server and frontend settings, such as port numbers and API endpoints.
4. Start the server: navigate to the server directory and run `npm start`
5. Start the frontend: navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm start`
6. Open your web browser and access the Fractal Visualizer application at `http://localhost:<port>`
